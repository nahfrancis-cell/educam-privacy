# Backend Structure Document


## Introduction


The backend of the Student GCE Questions Mobile App plays a crucial role in facilitating the application’s core functionalities, such as managing student data, serving the educational content, and ensuring secure payment transactions. Its design ensures that students can access past GCE exam questions through a seamless interface while administrators can manage and update content effortlessly. This document will guide you through the backend architecture, database management, hosting solutions, and all necessary infrastructure components that support the app's functionality.


## Backend Architecture


The backend architecture employs a JavaScript-based framework, making use of a RESTful API approach. This design is a common choice for web and mobile applications due to its simplicity and statelessness, which ensures scalability and easy maintenance. By encapsulating logical units of work into APIs, the backend can effectively handle requests made by the mobile app, manage data transactions, and ensure a robust flow of information. This modular design aids in maintaining performance, allowing the system to scale as the user base grows without affecting existing functionalities.


## Database Management


The application utilizes a SQL database for structured data management, likely opted for its robust support for complex queries required by the app’s performance tracking and analytical features. Supabase is incorporated, which offers a scalable solution for database hosting and support while simplifying the backend development with a Postgres database. Data is structured into tables representing users, questions, performance metrics, and other essential entities, allowing efficient storage, update, and retrieval operations. Access control to the database is strictly regulated to maintain data integrity and security.


## API Design and Endpoints


The API is designed based on RESTful principles, enabling a clear separation between client and server roles. Key endpoints include authentication APIs for student login and signup, a content-fetching API for retrieving GCE questions based on the selected criteria (exam level, subject, and topic), and performance submission endpoints that track and store user progress data. These APIs ensure that the frontend has continuous and secure access to the latest information and updates from the backend without heavy overhead.


## Hosting Solutions


The backend is hosted on a cloud environment, providing an optimal blend of reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. AWS (Amazon Web Services) may be leveraged given its global reach and extensive support for various infrastructural needs, paired with AWS S3 for storing image-based content due to its highly durable and scalable architecture. This cloud solution ensures that both static and dynamic content is delivered quickly, even during periods of high access demand.


## Infrastructure Components


The infrastructure is supported by load balancers that distribute incoming traffic efficiently, ensuring no single server is overwhelmed. A caching mechanism, such as Redis, could be implemented to temporarily store frequently accessed data in memory, speeding up response times for repeated requests. Utilizing Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) further optimizes data delivery by caching content at globally distributed nodes, reducing latency and enhancing user experience.


## Security Measures


To protect sensitive user data, robust security protocols are integral to the backend setup. Authentication is handled through encrypted channels, ensuring that login credentials are secure. Authorization ensures that users have access only to the functions intended for them, with specific rights granted to both students and administrators. Data encryption for payment transactions is enforced to comply with regulations, ensuring sensitive information is stored and transmitted securely.


## Monitoring and Maintenance


Monitoring the backend involves tools that track the health and performance of the infrastructure, allowing early detection of any issues and facilitating prompt resolution. Regularly scheduled maintenance ensures system updates are applied timely, keeping the backend components aligned with the latest advancements and security standards. Services like AWS CloudWatch or similar could be utilized to provide real-time insights into system performance and log management.


## Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary


The backend architecture of the Student GCE Questions Mobile App is a thoughtfully constructed, secure, and scalable system designed to meet the project’s objectives and user needs. It leverages a mix of cloud technologies and frameworks that enhance performance and reliability, managing educational content distribution and secure financial transactions effectively. This backend setup not only aligns well with mobile app development best practices but also ensures a high-quality user experience through integrated performance and monitoring capabilities.

Frontend components in the app are organized through a clear hierarchy, with each component handling specific functionalities to promote reusability and efficiency. This component-based architecture ensures that changes in one part of the app do not inadvertently affect others, enhancing maintainability. For instance, question navigation and performance metrics are handled by separate components, which are composed to create complex screens without duplicating code.


### State Management


The app uses React's Context API as the primary state management tool, ensuring that the application's state is efficiently handled and propagated throughout the component tree. This approach supports a seamless experience as data like user progress and selected questions are easily accessible and modifiable across multiple components without performance lags. By maintaining a global state, the application ensures consistent user experience across different sessions.


### Routing and Navigation


React Navigation is employed to manage routing within the application, creating a smooth transition between different app sections such as the dashboard, question screens, and performance trackers. The navigation structure is intuitive and designed to facilitate easy movement for students, so they can focus on learning and practicing rather than figuring out the app itself.


### Performance Optimization


Several optimization strategies are in place to ensure the frontend is both fast and efficient. Lazy loading is utilized to load components only as needed, reducing initial load times and conserving resources. Code splitting further aids in performance by breaking the app's bundle into manageable chunks that are loaded as necessary. Asset optimization, including image compression and caching, contributes to minimal load times and a faster user experience.


### Testing and Quality Assurance


Testing forms a critical part of the development process, ensuring reliability and quality of the frontend code. The app utilizes Expo Go CLI for testing, which facilitates the testing of both individual components and complete flows across different devices and platforms, ensuring consistency and spotting potential issues early. A combination of unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are employed to verify each functionality aspect, with continuous integration pipelines automating the process wherever possible.
